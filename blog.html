                <h3>difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>
                <p>Local Storage offers isolation per the Same Origin Policy, meaning that one origin cannot access the Local Storage of another Origin. Data stored there is saved across browser sessions, so if a user closes the browser tab or window, the data will still be available in the Local Storage when the user revisits the page.
                     <br> 
                     Session storage also offers isolation per Same Origin Policy, but there are some differences compared to Local Storage.

                     Data stored in Session storage is cleared when a browser session ends. Additionally, data stored in Session Storage is not shared between two different browser tabs or iframes.
