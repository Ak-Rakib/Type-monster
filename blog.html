                <h3>difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>
                <p>Local Storage offers isolation per the Same Origin Policy, meaning that one origin cannot access the Local Storage of another Origin. Data stored there is saved across browser sessions, so if a user closes the browser tab or window, the data will still be available in the Local Storage when the user revisits the page.
                     <br> 
                     Session storage also offers isolation per Same Origin Policy, but there are some differences compared to Local Storage.

                     Data stored in Session storage is cleared when a browser session ends. Additionally, data stored in Session Storage is not shared between two different browser tabs or iframes.

                <h3>difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
                <p>
                    In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed..
                     <br> 
                     A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.

                <h3>how does event loop work?</h3>
                <p>On each iteration, the event loop tries to synchronously pull out the next callback from the queue. 
                   If there is no callback to execute at the moment, pop() blocks the main thread. When the callback is ready, the event loop executes it.
                   The execution of a callback always happens synchronously
